## A  Very Amazing Calculator \[The MagiCalc v1\.0\.\.\. MSUT SEE\!\!\!\]


</div>

### Description

If you want to be amazed, then take a look at this calculator. It works like a powerful compiler that can evaluate complicated expressions and can amazingly handle syntax errors. Try this "+(2((5+4)/2*6+1.56845)4 + 3^(3-(--5)/2))/(25^.5)+2-3*4/-2^2.2*5". That's not all! Why don't you download the code, and let the calculator talks about itself?

The calculator has many amazing features:

1- It handles almost all kinds of possible errors (like a very powerful compiler), and when an error occures, it tells what and where the error is, so that you can fix it easily. Try this expression and see how errors get handled: "()+*5.334.2+)453+&amp;76/6(7+" .

2- It recolors the expression so that it seems more clear. ( Numbers in light blue, operations in purple, invalid inputs in red, positive and negative signs in dark green, and parenthesis in randome colors)

3- It saves previous inputs so if you want to review them, use the Up and Down arrows.

4- There is an input keyboard that can be shown or hidden.

5- It's very easy to use.

I hope that you'll find this program useful in solving math problems, and I hope that you'll like the code and find it helpful and easy to understand.

*** Would you kindly vote for this code ;) ***
